Yes it is neat, but its gotta be more than neat, especially when cheaper products can replicate a lot of its features. Also that battery life is fucking pathetic, 2-4 hours? When my quest 2 casually gets 4 hours and gets a hell of a lot more with a battery pack, again all for less than 10% of the cost, i cant really say its justifed at all. If this thing was maybe $1k i could bring myself to be more reasonable, but really its got nothing the others dont have besides great passthrough, the worst battery life of the lot, and basically no fun games or anything that are bespoke to it.

Wearing no headset, and seated at a non-VR table, she was unable to speak without her hands floating around her, memory-driven, as if plucking information within her VR space. Now ... I test at 99% Spatial Reasoning, and would adore using VR for everything ... but having seen her inability to disengage her body enough to retrieve thoughts and vocalize without that accompanying physical mimic ... made me realize I would never really want to go down such a virtual rabbit hole when I already enjoy an internal spatial vr-type-ability on my own.
